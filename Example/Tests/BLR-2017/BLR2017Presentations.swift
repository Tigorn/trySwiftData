I mean, you might think it takes just a wee bit of code to populate some array, but that's just peanuts compared to how many amazing ways you can use everything from closures to protocols to functional programming to build small collections for testing, prototyping, etc. </p><p>These kinds of tiny challenges open you to Swift's enormous design space. Just as it's a mistake to think you can solve any major problem with potatoes, Swift's power features help you move past obvious code to the expert, the arcane, and the reusable.

As a community, we love to talk about design patterns but we should get better at understanding the problems, not focusing on the concrete solutions. MVVM defines some principles and leaves a lot of uncertainty when applied to real-world iOS cases. <p></p>In this talk, we will see how these work in practice and step away from the reactive dogma to focus on the roles defined by the pattern."

You should be spending time crafting an application your users will love - not focused on the tedious tasks involved in setting up and maintaining infrastructure. In the process of building an iOS app, we realized we were spending more time fighting with our build and deployment system than actually building our app. We put the project on hold to build a better CI / CD platform for mobile developers - buddybuild. Today, buddybuild is trusted by companies like Slack, Washington Post, Firefox and thousands of others to reliably build, test and deploy their apps. In this talk, I onboard an app to buddybuild, deploy it to audience members and gather their feedback all in under 10 minutes."

But with the increasing rate of progress comes many questions that are uncomfortable to contemplate, and which may be dangerous to ignore. When should an autonomous vehicle sacrifice itself and its owner to protect others? What happens when medical expert systems work on behalf of insurance agencies rather than patients? What happens when the worldâ€™s weapon systemsâ€”including combat dronesâ€”are able to make lethal decisions without human involvement?</p><p>Emerging and autonomous technologies have enormous potential for benefiting humanity, but we need to discuss the ethics and risks of them nowâ€”and in a public spaceâ€”before widespread deployment occurs."

This workshop will help you setup your development environment, find a small bug to work on, and step through the development cycle. An accepted PR isn't the goal here, it is to explore the compiler, learn something new, and have fun. At the end of the day we hope to have everyone comfortable exploring and editing code, compiling Swift, and running the unit tests. Working on the compiler does require some comfort with C++, but if you're looking to stick to writing in Swift, there are still opportunities in the standard library and Foundation! The full development environment is pretty big, with the code taking up 2 gigs of space, and a full build directory taking up between 40 and 60! Given the time and space that this takes, all of the instructions we will be following will be sent out before the workshop. To get the most from the workshop time, we will request that you step through the instructions the week before the workshop. It's only a handful of commands, but it's a lot of time and bits!"
